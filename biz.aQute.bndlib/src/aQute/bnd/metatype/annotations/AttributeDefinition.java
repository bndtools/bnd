/**
 * {@code AttributeDefinition} information for the annotated method.
 * <p>
 * Each method of a type annotated by {@link ObjectClassDefinition} has an
 * implied AttributeDefinition annotation. This annotation is only used to
 * specify non-default AttributeDefinition information.
 * <p>
 * The {@code id} of this AttributeDefinition is generated from the name of the
 * annotated method as follows:
 * <ul>
 * <li>A single dollar sign ({@code '$'} &#92;u0024) is removed unless it is
 * followed by:
 * <ul>
 * <li>A low line ({@code '_'} &#92;u005F) and a dollar sign in which case the
 * three consecutive characters ( {@code "$_$"}) are changed to a single
 * hyphen-minus ({@code '-'} &#92;u002D).</li>
 * <li>Another dollar sign in which case the two consecutive dollar signs (
 * {@code "$$"}) are changed to a single dollar sign.</li>
 * </ul>
 * </li>
 * <li>A low line ({@code '_'} &#92;u005F) is changed to a full stop (
 * {@code '.'} &#92;u002E) unless is it followed by another low line in which
 * case the two consecutive low lines ({@code "__"}) are changed to a single low
 * line.</li>
 * <li>All other characters are unchanged.</li>
 * <li>If the type declaring the method also declares a {@code PREFIX_} field
 * whose value is a compile-time constant String, then the id is prefixed with
 * the value of the {@code PREFIX_} field.</li>
 * </ul>
 * However, if the type annotated by {@link ObjectClassDefinition} is a
 * <em>single-element annotation</em>, then the id for the {@code value} method
 * is derived from the name of the annotation type rather than the name of the
 * method. In this case, the simple name of the annotation type, that is, the
 * name of the class without any package name or outer class name, if the
 * annotation type is an inner class, must be converted to the {@code value}
 * method's id as follows:
 * <ul>
 * <li>When a lower case character is followed by an upper case character, a
 * full stop ({@code '.'} &#92;u002E) is inserted between them.</li>
 * <li>Each upper case character is converted to lower case.</li>
 * <li>All other characters are unchanged.</li>
 * <li>If the annotation type declares a {@code PREFIX_} field whose value is a
 * compile-time constant String, then the id is prefixed with the value of the
 * {@code PREFIX_} field.</li>
 * </ul>
 * This id is the value of the id attribute of the generate AD element and is
 * used as the name of the corresponding configuration property.
 * <p>
 * This annotation is not processed at runtime. It must be processed by tools
 * and used to contribute to a Meta Type Resource document for the bundle.
 *
 * @see "The AD element of a Meta Type Resource."
