/**
 * Identify the annotated annotation as a Component Property Type.
 * <p>
 * Component Property Types can be applied as annotations to the implementation
 * class of the Component. They can also be used as activation objects which
 * means they can be used as parameter types for the component's constructor and
 * life cycle methods {@link Activate}, {@link Deactivate}, and {@link Modified}
 * as well as activation fields.
 * <p>
 * Component Property Types do not have to be annotated with this annotation to
 * be used as parameter types but they must be annotated with this annotation to
 * be used as annotations on the implementation class of the Component.
 * <p>
 * This annotation is not processed at runtime by Service Component Runtime. It
 * must be processed by tools and used to add a Component Description to the
 * bundle.
 * 
 * @see "Component Property Types."
