/**
 * Identify the annotated member as part of the activation of a Service
 * Component.
 * <p>
 * When this annotation is applied to a:
 * <ul>
 * <li>Method - The method is the {@code activate} method of the Component.</li>
 * <li>Constructor - The constructor will be used to construct the Component and
 * can be called with activation objects and bound services as parameters.</li>
 * <li>Field - The field will contain an activation object of the Component. The
 * field must be set after the constructor is called and before calling any
 * other method on the fully constructed component instance. That is, there is a
 * <i>happens-before</i> relationship between the field being set and calling
 * any method on the fully constructed component instance such as the
 * {@code activate} method.</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * This annotation is not processed at runtime by Service Component Runtime. It
 * must be processed by tools and used to add a Component Description to the
 * bundle.
 * 
 * @see "The init, activate, and activation-fields attributes of the component element of a Component Description."
