 * to support Multi Release Jars (MRJ). These jars contain content that varies
 * depending on the JVM release it is deployed in. This could be modeled with a
 * supporting resource. The primary resource represents the "base" content. For
 * each range of VMs as used in the MRJ, a supporting resource is created that
 * provides the same capabilities and requires the appropriate requirements.
 * <p>
 * However, this could be useful in other cases so the current specification is
 * independent of this use case.
