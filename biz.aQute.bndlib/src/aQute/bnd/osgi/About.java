/**
 * This package contains a number of classes that assists by analyzing JARs and
 * constructing bundles. The Analyzer class can be used to analyze an existing
 * bundle and can create a manifest specification from proposed (wildcard)
 * Export-Package, Bundle-Includes, and Import-Package headers. The Builder
 * class can use the headers to construct a JAR from the classpath. The Verifier
 * class can take an existing JAR and verify that all headers are correctly set.
 * It will verify the syntax of the headers, match it against the proper
 * contents, and verify imports and exports. A number of utility classes are
 * available. Jar, provides an abstraction of a Jar file. It has constructors
 * for creating a Jar from a stream, a directory, or a jar file. A Jar, keeps a
 * collection Resource's. There are Resource implementations for File, from
 * ZipFile, or from a stream (which copies the data). The Jar tries to minimize
 * the work during build up so that it is cheap to use. The Resource's can be
 * used to iterate over the names and later read the resources when needed.
 * Clazz, provides a parser for the class files. This will be used to define the
 * imports and exports. Headers are translated to {@link Parameters} that
 * contains all headers (the order is maintained). The attribute of each header
 * are maintained in an {@link Attrs}. Each additional file in a header
 * definition will have its own entry (only native code does not work this way).
 * The ':' of directives is considered part of the name. This allows attributes
 * and directives to be maintained in the Attributes map. An important aspect of
 * the specification is to allow the use of wildcards. Wildcards select from a
 * set and can decorate the entries with new attributes. This functionality is
 * implemented in Instructions. Much of the information calculated is in
 * packages. A package is identified by a PackageRef (and a type by a TypeRef).
 * The namespace is maintained by {@link Descriptors}, which here is owned by
 * {@link Analyzer}. A special class, {@link Packages} maintains the attributes
 * that are found in the code.
 * 
 * @version $Revision: 1.2 $
