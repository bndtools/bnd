Bundle-Description: \
  Provides the service API specification to create constant objects that get dynamically bound to a \
  dynamic backing service when it is present. Primary purpose was to interact with Eclipse Extension \
  Points but the idea should work in any environment that is ignorant of dynamics and is oblivious of \
  life cycles.
