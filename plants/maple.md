# Maple

Maple trees are deciduous trees renowned for their spectacular fall foliage and the sweet sap that produces maple syrup. The genus Acer contains over 130 species found throughout the Northern Hemisphere.

## Characteristics

Maples are recognized by:
- Distinctive palmate (hand-shaped) leaves with 3-9 lobes
- Winged seeds (samaras) that spin like helicopters
- Opposite leaf arrangement
- Smooth bark when young, becoming ridged with age
- Brilliant fall colors

## Popular Species

- Sugar Maple (Acer saccharum) - maple syrup production
- Red Maple (Acer rubrum) - ornamental and widespread
- Japanese Maple (Acer palmatum) - ornamental with delicate foliage
- Silver Maple (Acer saccharinum) - fast-growing shade tree
- Norway Maple (Acer platanoides) - urban tolerant

## Maple Syrup Production

Sugar maples are tapped in late winter:
- Sap flows when temperatures rise above freezing during the day
- Takes 40 gallons of sap to make 1 gallon of syrup
- Tapping doesn't harm the tree when done properly
- Trees must be at least 10 inches in diameter

## Uses

- Maple syrup and sugar production
- Hardwood lumber for furniture and flooring
- Ornamental landscaping
- Shade trees
- Musical instruments (violin backs, guitar tops)
- Wildlife habitat
