Bundle-Description: \
	The HttpTestServer Provides an HTTP(S) server that is very easy to extend by creating a subclass. \
	Methods that start with `_` are treated as paths. That is, `get_foo()` maps to `get/foo`. Remaining \
	path and parameters are mapped to the method. See Httpbin as an example. This example implements a lot \
	of methods that are very useful to test HTTP communication.
