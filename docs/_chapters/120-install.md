---

bnd is not a single product, it is a library (bndlib) used in many different software build environments. It runs inside Maven, ant, gradle, Eclipse, sbt, and maybe one day in Intellij. To install bnd, you will have to install these tools. 

<div>
<ul class="property-index">

{% for tool in site.tools %}<li><a href="{{ tool.url | prepend: site.github.url }}">{{tool.title}}</a> {{tool.summary}}</li>
{% endfor %}

</ul>
</div>

## Command Line
That said, there is also a command line version of bnd, providing an easy way to try out its many features. You can install bnd through [brew][1] on MacOS.

You can also run bnd command as executable jar, which can be downloaded from [JFrog][7]:
```bash

```

## Libraries
The binaries are available on [JFrog][4]. The latest version can be found at:

## Source Code
