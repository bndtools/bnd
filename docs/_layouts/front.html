		<h1>What is bnd?</h1>
		<p>
			bnd is the engine behind a number of popular software development
			tools that support OSGi. It can be found in several maven plugins,
			ant, gradle, and of course Eclipse (<a href="https://bndtools.org">bndtools</a>).
			It actively seeks other build tool vendors to use bnd to improve the
			quality of the generated OSGi metadata.
		</p>
		<p>bnd actually consists of 2 major parts, one part is really
			good in creating a JAR with OSGi meta data based on instructions and
			the information in the class files. Over time bnd has collected
			hundreds of heuristics that provide for good bundles. This part is
			therefore often used in build tools like maven or gradle that
			already generate JARs. They mainly use the manifest generation
			features of bnd.
		</p>
		<p>The other part is a IDE/build tool independent model of a
			workspace with projects. This was the result of the frustration that
			certain things could be done very well in Eclipse but that other
			things are best done in a command line tool. Since IDEs are
			incremental and very event driven, command line tools tend to run
			everything from start to end. What was needed was an independent
			model that could work with Eclipse, maven, ant, gradle, and
			hopefully one day Intellij.
		</p>
		<p>So to use bnd, look at the the descriptions of the tools that
			include bnd. Then when you want to find out what a certain command
			does, or how to call a macro, then use this manual.
		</p>
		<p>
			Last but not least, the whole source code is on GitHub. So feel
			free to explore it. And when you like, we&#39;re very actively taken outside PR&#39;s. There is a
			lot of activity going on.</p>
