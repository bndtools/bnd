summary: Options for controlling DS annotation processing.
---


The `-dsannotations-options` instruction configures how DS component annotations are processed and what metadata is generated.

```properties
-dsannotations-options: version;minimum=1.2.0
```

The example above, will restrict the use of OSGi DS annotations to minimum 1.2.0 version. The version number denotes that the users are free to use any version equal to or higher than 1.2.0, provided that the users have the SCR annotations included in the workspace.

It is also possible to set a `maximum`. The maximum will generate an error if the use of DS causes a version number that is higher than the given `maximum`. For example:

```properties
-dsannotations-options: version;minimum=1.2.0;maximum=1.2.0
```
    
The following options are supported:

|option||
|-|-|
|inherit|use DS annotations found in the class hierarchy of the component class|
|felixExtensions|enables features proprietary to Apache Felix SCR|
|extender|add the `osgi.extender=osgi.component` requirement to the manifest|
|nocapabilities|do not add `osgi.service` capabilities to the manifest|
|norequirements|do not add `osgi.service` requirements to the manifest|
|version|set the minimum version of the `osgi.extender=osgi.component` requirement added to the manifest. It is also possible to set a maximum. The maximum generates an error when the calculated version of the component is higher.|
