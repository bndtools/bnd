				<h1> -contract</h1>
				<p>Though the OSGi has a very elegant package version model there are still many that think this is too much work. They do not want to be bothered by the niceties of semantic versions and just want to use, let’s say, Servlet 3.0. For those people (seemingly not interested in minimizing dependencies) the OSGi Alliance came up with contracts in OSGi Core, Release 5.0.0. A contract allows you to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Declare that a bundle provides the API of the given specification</li>
  <li>Require that the API comes from a bundle that made the declaration</li>
</ul>

<p>This very common pattern is called the Capability/Requirement (C/R) model in OSGi, it underlies all of its dependency concepts like Import/Export package and others; it forms the foundation of the OSGi Bundle Repository. If you ever want to know what is happening deep down inside a framework than look at the Wiring API and you see the requirements and capabilities in their most fundamental form.</p>

<p>Capabilities declare a set of properties that describe something that a bundle can provide. A Requirement in a bundle has a filter that must match a capability before this bundle can be resolved. To prevent requirements matching completely unrelated capabilities they must both be defined in the same namespace, where the namespace then defines the semantics of the properties. Using the C/R model we were able to describe most of the OSGi dependencies with surprisingly few additional concepts. For a modern OSGi resolver there is very little difference between the <code class="highlighter-rouge">Import-Package</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">Require-Bundle</code> headers.</p>

<p>So how do those contracts work? Well, the bundle that provides the API for the contract has a contract capability. What this means is that it provides a <code class="highlighter-rouge">Provide-Capability</code> clause in the <code class="highlighter-rouge">osgi.contract</code> namespace, for example:</p>

<div class="language-properties highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="c"># Bundle P:
</span><span class="py">Provide-Capability</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="se">\
</span>  <span class="s">osgi.contract;</span><span class="se">\
</span>    <span class="s">osgi.contract=Servlet;</span><span class="se">\
</span>    <span class="s">uses:="javax.servlet,javax.servlet.http";</span><span class="se">\
</span>    <span class="s">version="3.0"</span>
<span class="py">Export-Package</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="s">javax.servlet, javax.servlet.http</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This contract defines two properties, the contract name (by convention this is the namespace name as property key) and the version. A bundle that wants to rely on this API can add the following requirement to its manifest:</p>

<div class="language-properties highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="c"># Bundle R:
</span><span class="py">Require-Capability</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="se">\
</span>  <span class="s">osgi.contract;</span><span class="se">\
</span>    <span class="s">filter:="(&amp;(osgi.contract=Servlet)(version=3.0))"</span>
<span class="py">Import-Package</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="s">javax.servlet, javax.servlet.http</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Experienced OSGi users should have cringed at these versionless packages, cringing becomes a gut-reaction at the sight of versionless packages. However, in this case it actually cannot harm. The previous example will ensure that Bundle P will be the class loader for the Bundle R for packages javax.servlet, javax.servlet.http. The magic is in the <code class="highlighter-rouge">uses:</code> directive, if the <code class="highlighter-rouge">Require-Capability</code> in bundle R is resolved to the <code class="highlighter-rouge">Provide-Capability</code> in bundle P then bundle R must import these packages from bundle P.</p>

<p>Obviously bnd has support for this (well, since today, i.e. version <code class="highlighter-rouge">osgi:biz.aQute.bndlib@2.2.0.20130806-071947</code> or later). First bnd can make it easier to create the <code class="highlighter-rouge">Provide-Capability</code> header since the involved packages are in the <code class="highlighter-rouge">Export-Package</code> as well as in the <code class="highlighter-rouge">Provide-Capability</code> headers. The do-no-repeat-yourself mantra dictated am <code class="highlighter-rouge">${exports}</code> macro. The <code class="highlighter-rouge">${exports}</code> macro is replaced by the exported packages of the bundle, for example:</p>

<div class="language-properties highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="c"># Bundle P:
</span><span class="py">Provide-Capability</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="se">\
</span>  <span class="s">osgi.contract;</span><span class="se">\
</span>    <span class="s">osgi.contract=Servlet;</span><span class="se">\
</span>    <span class="s">uses:="${exports}";</span><span class="se">\
</span>    <span class="s">version="3.0"</span>
<span class="py">Export-Package</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="s">javax.servlet, javax.servlet.http</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>That said, the most extensive help you get from bnd is for requiring contracts. Providing a contract is not so cumbersome, after all you’re the provider so you have all the knowledge and the interest in providing metadata. Consuming a contract is less interesting and it is much harder to get the metadata right. In a similar vein, bnd analyzes your classes to find out the dependencies to create the <code class="highlighter-rouge">Import-Package</code> statement, doing this by hand is really hard (as other OSGi developing environments can testify!)</p>

<p>So to activate the use of contracts, add the <code class="highlighter-rouge">-contract</code> instruction:</p>

<div class="language-properties highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="c"># bnd.bnd:
</span><span class="py">-contract</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="s">*</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This instruction will give bnd permission to scan the build path for contracts, i.e. <code class="highlighter-rouge">Provide-Capability</code> clauses in the <code class="highlighter-rouge">osgi.contract</code> namespace. These declared contracts cause a corresponding requirement in the bundle when the bundle imports packages listed in the uses clause. In the example with Bundle R, bnd will automatically insert the <code class="highlighter-rouge">Require-Capability</code> header and remove any versions on the imported packages.</p>

<p>Sometimes the wildcard for the <code class="highlighter-rouge">-contract</code> instruction can be used to limit the contracts that are considered. Sometimes you want a specific contract but not others. Other times you want to skip a specific contract. The following example skips the ‘Servlet’ contract:</p>

<div class="language-properties highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="py">bnd.bnd</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="se">\
</span>  <span class="s">-contract: !Servlet,*</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><strong>Note</strong>: As of bnd 4.1.0 the default value for the <code class="highlighter-rouge">-contract</code> instruction will be <code class="highlighter-rouge">*</code> which result in the automatic application of any contracts found at build time.</p>

<p>The tests provide some examples for people that want to have a deeper understanding: https://github.com/bndtools/bnd/blob/next/biz.aQute.bndlib.tests/src/test/ContractTest.java</p>
