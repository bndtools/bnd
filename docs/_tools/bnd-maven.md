summary: The Bnd Maven Plugins from the Bnd developers.

Our preferred workflow for new projects it either [Eclipse Workspace](https://bndtools.org/) or [Gradle](/tools/bnd-gradle.html)

However, bnd provides maven plugins
and there is a great introduction to bnd with Maven at the [OSGi enRoute](https://enroute.osgi.org/) site.

OSGi enRoute is based on these Maven plugins.

See the [documentation on GitHub][1] for details on how to configure and use the Bnd Maven Plugins.
