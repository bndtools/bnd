 * The Bundleâ€™s Require-Capability header
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Typically used as a meta-annotation, i.e. an annotation placed on another
 * annotation, which we will call the <em>user-defined annotation</em>. When the
 * user-defined annotation is found on a class within the bundle, an entry in
 * the <code>Require-Capability</code> header is added. The filter expression of
 * the requirement may be parameterised with values from the user-defined
 * annotation. For example, given the following declarations:
 * </p>
 * 
 * <pre>
 * &#64;RequireCapability( ns = "com.acme.engine", effective = "active", filter = "(com.acme.engine=${type})") 
 * public &#64;interface Engine { String type(); }
 * &#64;Engine(type = "wankel") public class Vehicle { ... }
 * </pre>
 * <p>
 * ... the following header will be generated in MANIFEST.MF:
 * </p>
 * 
 * <pre>
 * Require-Capability:\ com.acme.engine; \ effective:=active; \
 *  filter:="(com.acme.engine=wankel)",\ ...
 * </pre>
