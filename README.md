# README Bnd/Bndtools

Bnd/Bndtools is a swiss army knife for OSGi. It creates manifest headers for you based on analyzing the class code, it verifies your settings, it manages project dependencies, diffs jars, and much more.

Information about Bnd can be found at <https://bnd.bndtools.org> and information about Bndtools can be found at <https://bndtools.org>.

## API

Though we are usually pretty good at backward compatibility, there is no guarantee.
This is an unpaid project. Bnd properties will be backward compatible if there is any possibility.

If you're building a tool with a general audience  that includes Bnd for a general audience I would appreciate if you got in touch with us so we can keep in touch. We are always interested in ideas.

## Eclipse

Bndtools is the development environment of Bnd.

## Building

We use Gradle and Maven to build and the repo includes `gradlew` and `mvnw` at the necessary versions.
We require at least Java 8.

- `./gradlew :build` - Assembles and tests the Bnd Workspace projects. This must be run before building the Bnd Maven and Gradle plugins.
- `./gradlew :gradle-plugins:build` - Assembles and tests the Bnd Gradle plugins.
- `./mvnw --file=maven install` - Assembles and tests the Bnd Maven plugins.
- `./gradlew :publish` - Assembles and publishes the Bnd Workspace projects into `dist/bundles`.
- `./gradlew :gradle-plugins:publish` - Assembles and publishes the Bnd Gradle plugins into `dist/bundles`.
- `./mvnw -Pdist --file=maven deploy` - Assembles and publishes the Bnd Maven plugins into `dist/bundles`.

Bnd/Bndtools is continuously built on [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/bndtools/bnd/actions/workflows/cibuild.yml).
[![GitHub Actions CI Build Status](https://github.com/bndtools/bnd/actions/workflows/cibuild.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/bndtools/bnd/actions/workflows/cibuild.yml)

[CodeQL](https://github.com/bndtools/bnd/security/code-scanning?query=tool%3ACodeQL) is used for continuous security analysis.

A Maven snapshot repository of the latest build is available at <https://bndtools.jfrog.io/bndtools/libs-snapshot-local>.
