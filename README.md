# README Bnd/Bndtools
Bnd/Bndtools is a swiss army knife for OSGi, it creates manifest headers for you based on 
analyzing the class code, it verifies your settings, it manages project dependencies,
gives you quote of the day, diffs jars, and much more. 

Information about Bnd can be found at <https://bnd.bndtools.org> and 
information about Bndtools can be found at <https://bndtools.org>.

## API
Though we am usually pretty good at backward compatibility, there is no guarantee. This
is an unpaid project. Bnd properties will be backward compatible
if there is any possibility.

If you're building a tool with a general audience  that includes Bnd 
for a general audience I would appreciate if you got in touch with us so we can keep 
in touch. We are always interested in ideas.

## Eclipse
Bndtools is the development environment of Bnd.

## Building
Gradle is used to build Bnd/Bndtools. The workspace root has a `build.gradle` file that builds all projects in proper order.

`./gradlew`              - Assembles, tests and releases the non-maven projects into `dist/bundles`  
`./gradlew :build :maven:deploy`  - Assembles and releases the projects into `dist/bundles`  

The workspace root includes the gradle wrapper, `gradlew`, command.
