[![Plugin Portal](https://img.shields.io/gradle-plugin-portal/v/biz.aQute.bnd.builder)](https://plugins.gradle.org/plugin/biz.aQute.bnd.builder)

Bnd includes Gradle plugins for [Gradle][1] users to build Bnd projects in [Bnd Workspace builds][20] as well as in [non-Bnd Workspace builds][21].
A typical Gradle build is a non-Bnd workspace build.
A Bnd Workspace build uses the information specified in the Bnd Workspace's `cnf/build.bnd` file and each project's `bnd.bnd` file to configure the Gradle projects and tasks.

The [`biz.aQute.bnd.gradle`][2] jar contains the Bnd Gradle Plugins.
These plugins require Java 17 and
at least Gradle 7.3 for Java 17,
at least Gradle 7.5 for Java 18,
and at least Gradle 7.6 for Java 19.

This README represents the capabilities and features of the Bnd Gradle Plugins in the branch containing this README.
So for the `master` branch, this will be the [latest development SNAPSHOT build](#using-the-latest-development-snapshot-build-of-the-bnd-gradle-plugins).
See the appropriate Git tag for the README for the Bnd Gradle Plugin version you are using.

# Gradle Plugin for non-Bnd Workspace Builds

Bnd offers [Gradle][1] support for building bundles in _typical_ Gradle build environments.
There are two ways this support can be used.
You can apply the `biz.aQute.bnd.builder` plugin to your project and/or you can use the new task types:

* `Bundle`
* `Baseline`
* `Resolve`
* `Export`
* `TestOSGi`
* `Index`
* `Bndrun`

## Using Bnd Builder Gradle Plugin

To make the Bnd Builder Gradle Plugin available to your build, use the following in `settings.gradle`:

```groovy
pluginManagement {
  plugins {
    id "biz.aQute.bnd.builder" version "7.0.0"
  }
}
```

The Gradle marker plugins for the Bnd Gradle plugins are also in Maven Central.
So you may use Maven Central as a `pluginManagement` repository.

## Apply the `biz.aQute.bnd.builder` plugin to your project

To apply the `biz.aQute.bnd.builder` plugin to your project, use the following in `build.gradle`:

```groovy
plugins {
  id "biz.aQute.bnd.builder"
}
```

This plugin extends the normal [`java` plugin][3] by:

* Extending the `jar` task by adding a `bundle` extension.
The  `jar` task actions are also extended to use Bnd to generate a bundle.
The bundle will contain all the content configured into the `jar` task plus whatever additional content is included via the Bnd instructions.
The `bndfile` property of the task's `bundle` extension is set to `file("bnd.bnd")` if a `bnd.bnd` file exists in the project folder.
* Adds a `baseline` configuration.
* Adds a `baseline` task of type `Baseline` which baselines the bundle generated by the `jar` task against the prior version of that bundle in the repositories.

If you don't want to apply the plugin to the project but just need to use the task types, you can access the types with:

```groovy
plugins {
  id "biz.aQute.bnd.builder" apply false
}
```

## Gradle Configuration Cache Support

By default, the tasks of the Gradle Plugin for non-Bnd Workspace Builds use the Gradle Project object at task execution time to allow the Bnd instructions to resolve macro references such as `${project.group}` which evaluates to the value of the `group` property of the Gradle Project object.
However, Gradle's [Configuration Cache][23] support requires that a Gradle Project object cannot be used at task execution time.
To prevent a task of the Gradle Plugin for non-Bnd Workspace Builds from using the Gradle Project object at task execution time, the task's `properties` property must be set to some value.
This can be simply done by setting it empty.
For example:

```groovy
tasks.named("jar") {
  bundle {
    properties.empty()
  }
}
```

If you need to reference some project properties in the Bnd instructions and still use the Configuration Cache, then you will need to put the needed project properties in the task's `properties` property.
For example:

```groovy
tasks.named("jar") {
  bundle {
    properties.put("project.group", provider({project.group}))
  }
}
```

This sets the `project.group` key in the `properties` property to the value of a provider which returns the value of the project's `group` property.  A provider is used for late binding of the value.

## Create a task of the `Bundle` type

The `Bundle` task type is an extension of the [`Jar` task type][18] that adds a `bundle` extension with properties and uses Bnd to generate a bundle.
The bundle will contain all the content configured into the task plus whatever additional content is included via the Bnd instructions.
For example:

```groovy
import aQute.bnd.gradle.Bundle

tasks.register("bundle",  Bundle) {
  from sourceSets.main.output
}
```

In either usage mode, the following `bundle` extension properties, in addition to the `Jar` task properties, can be configured.

### bndfile

The bnd file to use to create the bundle.
If this property is not set or the bnd file does not exist, then the `bnd` property will be used.

### bnd

The Bnd instructions to use to create the bundle.
This property is ignored if the `bndfile` property refers to a file that exists.
If the `bndfile` property is not set or does not refer to a file that exists, or this property is not set, this is OK.
But without some instructions to Bnd, your bundle will not be very interesting.

### sourceSet

The SourceSet object to use for the Bnd builder.
The default value is _${project.sourceSets.main}_.
You will only need to specify this property if you want to use a different SourceSet or the default SourceSet does not exist.

### classpath

The FileCollection object to use as the classpath for the Bnd builder.
The default value is _${project.sourceSets.main.compileClasspath}_.
You will only need to specify this property if you want to specify additional classpath elements or replace the classpath.

### properties

Properties that are available for evaluation of the Bnd instructions.
The default is the properties of the Gradle task and project objects.

### Example

```groovy
import aQute.bnd.gradle.Bundle

configurations {
  bundleCompile
}
sourceSets {
  bundle
}
tasks.register("bundle", Bundle) {
  from sourceSets.bundle.output
  bundle {
    bndfile = file("bundle.bnd")
    sourceSet = sourceSets.bundle
    classpath = sourceSets.bundle.compileClasspath
  }
}
```

### Instructing Bnd on how to build your bundle

The normal way to instruct Bnd on how to build the bundle is to use a bnd file.
This file will specify the Bnd instructions like `-exportcontents`, etc.
You can also use the `bnd` property of the `bundle` extension.
It can be used in several different ways.
You can configure the `bnd` property with a multiline string:

```groovy
jar {
  bundle {
    bnd '''
-exportcontents: com.acme.api.*
-sources: true
-include: other.bnd
'''
  }
}
```

You can also configure the `bnd` property with map notation:

```groovy
jar {
  bundle {
    bnd("-exportcontents": "com.acme.api.*",
      "-sources": "true",
      "-include": "other.bnd")
  }
}
```

Finally, you can also use the `manifest` property to instruct Bnd.
For example:

```groovy
jar {
  manifest {
    attributes("-exportcontents": "com.acme.api.*",
      "-sources": "true",
      "-include": "other.bnd")
  }
}
```

You can even use a combination of the `manifest` property and a `bundle` extension property.
But the `bundle` extension property takes priority over the `manifest` property.
So if the same instruction is in both places, the one in the `bundle` extension property will be used and the one in the `manifest` property will be ignored.

### Replacing use of Gradle's deprecated OSGi Plugin

In Gradle 5.0, the [OSGi Plugin was deprecated][22].
If you used the OSGi Plugin and want to switch to the Bnd Gradle Plugin, you will need to modify your build scripts.
In addition to applying the `biz.aQute.bnd.builder` plugin to replace the OSGi Plugin, you will need to change usage of the `OSGiManifest`'s `instruction` property to use the `bnd` property.

For example:

```groovy
jar {
  manifest { // the manifest of the default jar is of type OsgiManifest
    name = "overwrittenSpecialOsgiName"
    instruction "Bundle-Vendor", "MyCompany"
    instruction "Bundle-Description", "Platform2: Metrics 2 Measures Framework"
    instruction "Bundle-DocURL", "https://www.mycompany.com"
  }
}
```

becomes:

```groovy
jar {
  bundle {
    bnd("Bundle-Name": "overwrittenSpecialOsgiName",
      "Bundle-Vendor": "MyCompany",
      "Bundle-Description": "Platform2: Metrics 2 Measures Framework",
      "Bundle-DocURL": "https://www.mycompany.com")
  }
}
```

Use of the convenience properties on `OSGiManifest` must be replaced with the specifying the actual OSGi manifest header name in the Bnd instructions.
For example, `name = "overwrittenSpecialOsgiName"` is replaced with `bnd "Bundle-Name: overwrittenSpecialOsgiName"`.

## Create a task of the `Baseline` type

The `Baseline` task type will baseline a bundle against a different version of the bundle.
For example:

```groovy
import aQute.bnd.gradle.Baseline

configurations {
  baseline
}
dependencies {
  baseline("group": group, "name": jar.archiveBaseName) {
    version {
      strictly "(0,${jar.archiveVersion.get()}["
    }
    transitive = false
  }
}
tasks.register("baseline", Baseline) {
  bundle = jar
  baseline = configurations.baseline
}
```

The following properties can be configured for a Baseline task:

### ignoreFailures

If `true` the build will not fail due to baseline problems; instead an error message will be logged.
Otherwise, the build will fail.
The default is `false`.

### baselineReportDirName

The name of the baseline reports directory.
Can be a name or a path relative to the project's [`reporting.baseDirectory`][19].
The default name is `baseline`.

### baselineReportDirectory

The baseline reports directory.
The default is _${project.reporting.baseDirectory.dir(baselineReportDirName)}_.

### reportFile

The baseline report file.
The default is _${baselineReportDirectory.file("${task.name}/${bundlename}.txt")}_.

### bundle

The bundle to be baselined.
It can be anything that `ConfigurableFileCollection.files(Object...)` can accept to result in a single file.
Typically this will be the task that builds the bundle.
This property must be set.

### baseline

The baseline bundle.
It can be anything that `ConfigurableFileCollection.files(Object...)` can accept to result in a single file.
Typically this will be a configuration that contains the earlier version of the bundle to baseline against.
This property must be set.

### diffpackages

The names of the exported packages in the bundle to baseline.
The default is all the exported packages but this property can be used to [specify](https://bnd.bndtools.org/chapters/820-instructions.html#selector) which exported packages are baselined.

### diffignore

The manifest header names and resource paths to ignore when baseline comparing.
This property can be used to [exclude](https://bnd.bndtools.org/chapters/820-instructions.html#selector) items from baseline comparison.

For example, to exclude bundle versions from baseline comparison, add `Bundle-Version` to `diffignore`.

## Create a task of the `Resolve` type

The `Resolve` task type will resolve a standalone bndrun file and set the `-runbundles` property in the file.
For example:

```groovy
import aQute.bnd.gradle.Resolve

def resolveTask = tasks.register("resolve", Resolve) {
  bndrun = file("my.bndrun")
  outputBndrun = layout.buildDirectory.file("my.bndrun")
}
```

The following properties can be configured for a Resolve task:

### ignoreFailures

If `true` the task will not fail due to resolution failures; instead an error message will be logged.
Otherwise, the task will fail.
The default is `false`.

### failOnChanges

If `true` the task will fail if the resolve process changes the value of the `-runbundles` property.
The default is `false`.

### writeOnChanges

If `true` the task will write changes to the value of the `-runbundles` property.
The default is `true`.

### bndrun

The bndrun file to be resolved.
This property must be set.

### outputBndrun

This is the output file for the calculated `-runbundles` property.
The default is the input `bndrun` file which means the input `bndrun` file will be updated in place.
If the output file is set to a different file than the input `bndrun` file, the generated output file will `-include` the input `bndrun` file and can be thus be used by other tasks, such as `TestOSGi`, as a resolved input `bndrun` file.

### workingDirectory

The directory for the resolve process.
The default is _${temporaryDir}_.

### bundles

The collection of files to use for locating bundles during the resolve process.
The default is _${project.sourceSets.main.runtimeClasspath}_ plus _${project.configurations.archives.artifacts.files}_.
This property must not be used for and is ignored in Bnd Workspace builds.

### reportOptional

If `true` failure reports will include optional requirements.
The default is `true`.

### properties

Properties that are available for evaluation of the Bnd instructions.
The default is the properties of the Gradle task and project objects.
This property must not be used for and is ignored in Bnd Workspace builds.

## Create a task of the `Export` type

The `Export` task type will export a standalone bndrun file.
For example:

```groovy
import aQute.bnd.gradle.Export

tasks.register("export", Export) {
  bndrun = file("my.bndrun")
}
```

The following properties can be configured for an Export task:

### ignoreFailures

If `true` the task will not fail due to export failures; instead an error message will be logged.
Otherwise, the task will fail.
The default is `false`.

### exporter

Bnd has two built-in exporter plugins.
`bnd.executablejar` exports an executable jar and `bnd.runbundles` exports the `-runbundles` files.
The exporter plugin with the specified name must be an installed exporter plugin.
The default is `bnd.executablejar`.

### bndrun

The bndrun file to be exported.
This property must be set.

### destinationDirectory

The directory for the output.

### workingDirectory

The directory for the export operation.
The default is _${temporaryDir}_.

### bundles

The collection of files to use for locating bundles during the bndrun export.
The default is _${project.sourceSets.main.runtimeClasspath}_ plus _${project.configurations.archives.artifacts.files}_.
This property must not be used for and is ignored in Bnd Workspace builds.

### properties

Properties that are available for evaluation of the Bnd instructions.
The default is the properties of the Gradle task and project objects.
This property must not be used for and is ignored in Bnd Workspace builds.

## Create a task of the `TestOSGi` type

The `TestOSGi` task type will execute tests in a standalone bndrun file.
This example uses the output bndrun file from the `Resolve` task example above:

```groovy
import aQute.bnd.gradle.TestOSGi

tasks.register("testOSGi", TestOSGi) {
  bndrun = resolveTask.flatMap { it.outputBndrun }
}
```

The following properties can be configured for a TestOSGi task:

### ignoreFailures

If `true` the task will not fail due to test case failures; instead an error message will be logged.
Otherwise, the task will fail.
The default is `false`.

### bndrun

The bndrun file to be tested.
This property must be set.

### workingDirectory

The directory for the test execution.
The default is _${temporaryDir}_.

### bundles

The collection of files to use for locating bundles during the bndrun execution.
The default is _${project.sourceSets.main.runtimeClasspath}_ plus _${project.configurations.archives.artifacts.files}_.
This property must not be used for and is ignored in Bnd Workspace builds.

### tests

The list of fully qualified names of test classes to run.
If not set, or empty, then all the test classes listed in the `Test-Classes` manifest header are run.
The `--tests` command line option can be used to set the fully qualified name of a test class to run.
This can be repeated multiple times to specify multiple test classes to run.

Use a colon (`:`) to specify a test method to run on the specified test class.

### resultsDirectory

The directory for the test results.
The default is _${project.java.testResultsDir}/${task.name}_.

### javaLauncher

Specify the default java executable to be used for execution.
This java launcher is used if the bndrun does not specify the `java` property or specifies it with the default value `java`.

### properties

Properties that are available for evaluation of the Bnd instructions.
The default is the properties of the Gradle task and project objects.
This property must not be used for and is ignored in Bnd Workspace builds.

## Create a task of the `Index` type

The `Index` task type will generate an index for a set of bundles.
For example:

```groovy
import aQute.bnd.gradle.Index

tasks.register("index", Index) {
  destinationDirectory = layout.buildDirectory.dir("libs")
  gzip = true
  bundles = fileTree(destinationDirectory) {
    include "**/*.jar"
    exclude "**/*-sources.jar"
    exclude "**/*-javadoc.jar"
    builtBy tasks.withType(Jar)
  }
}
```

The following properties can be configured for an Index task:

### gzip

If `true`, then a gzip'd copy of the index will be made with a `.gz` extension.
Otherwise, only the uncompressed index will be made.
The default is `false`.

### indexName

The name of the index file.
The file is created in the destinationDirectory.
The default is`index.xml`.

### repositoryName

The name attribute in the generated index.
The default is the name of the task.

### destinationDirectory

The destination directory for the index.
The default value is _${project.layout.buildDirectory}_.

### base

The URI base for the generated index.
The default value is the file: URI of _destinationDirectory_.

### bundles

The bundles to be indexed.
It can be anything that `ConfigurableFileCollection.files(Object...)` can accept.
This property must be set.

### indexUncompressed

The output file for the uncompressed index.
The default value is _${destinationDir}/${indexName}_.

### indexCompressed

The output file for the compressed index.
The default value is _${destinationDir}/${indexName}.gz_.

## Create a task of the `Bndrun` type

The `Bndrun` task type will execute a bndrun file.
For example:

```groovy
import aQute.bnd.gradle.Bndrun

tasks.register("run", Bndrun) {
  bndrun = file("my.bndrun")
}
```

The following properties can be configured for a Bndrun task:

### ignoreFailures

If `true` the task will not fail due to execution failures; instead an error message will be logged.
Otherwise, the task will fail.
The default is `false`.

### bndrun

The bndrun file to be executed.
This property must be set.

### workingDirectory

The directory for the execution.
The default is _${temporaryDir}_.

### bundles

The collection of files to use for locating bundles during the bndrun execution.
The default is _${project.sourceSets.main.runtimeClasspath}_ plus _${project.configurations.archives.artifacts.files}_.
This property must not be used for and is ignored in Bnd Workspace builds.

### javaLauncher

Specify the default java executable to be used for execution.
This java launcher is used if the bndrun does not specify the `java` property or specifies it with the default value `java`.

### properties

Properties that are available for evaluation of the Bnd instructions.
The default is the properties of the Gradle task and project objects.
This property must not be used for and is ignored in Bnd Workspace builds.

# Gradle Plugins for Bnd Workspace Builds

The Bnd Gradle Plugins for Bnd Workspace builds uses the information specified in the Bnd Workspace's `cnf/build.bnd` file and each project's `bnd.bnd` file to build the projects.

The Bnd Gradle Plugins for Bnd Workspace builds consists of two plugins:

* The `biz.aQute.bnd.workspace` Gradle plugin can be applied in the `settings.gradle` file or the Bnd Workspace folder's `build.gradle` file.
* The `biz.aQute.bnd` Gradle plugin is applied to each subproject that is a Bnd project.
The `biz.aQute.bnd.workspace` Gradle plugin will automatically apply the `biz.aQute.bnd` Gradle plugin to the Gradle projects for all the identified Bnd Workspace projects.

## Bnd Workspace

A Bnd Workspace is a folder containing a `cnf` project as well as a number of peer folders each holding a Bnd project.
So the Bnd Workspace folder is the main project of the Gradle build for the Bnd Workspace.
The following files are in the root project:

* [`gradle.properties`][11] - Some initial properties to configure the Gradle build for the workspace.
* [`settings.gradle`][12] - Initializes the projects to be included in the Gradle build for the workspace.
* [`build.gradle`][13] - Configures the Gradle build for the workspace.

When creating a new Bnd Workspace with Bndtools, it will put these files on the root folder of the workspace.

These files can be modified to customize the overall Gradle build for the Bnd Workspace.
If special Gradle build behavior for a project is needed, beyond changes to the project's `bnd.bnd` file, then you should place a `build.gradle` file in the project folder and place your customizations in there.

## Using Bnd Gradle Plugins for Bnd Workspace builds

If you are using the Gradle build added by Bndtools when creating the the Bnd Workspace, you don't need to do anything else.

If you want to use the Bnd Gradle Plugins in your existing Gradle build, there are two approaches you can take.
The main approach is to edit `settings.gradle` as follows:

```groovy
plugins {
  id "biz.aQute.bnd.workspace" version "7.0.0"
}
```
The Gradle marker plugins for the Bnd Gradle plugins are also in Maven Central.
So you may use Maven Central as a `pluginManagement` repository.

When you apply the `biz.aQute.bnd.workspace` Gradle plugin in the `settings.gradle` file, the plugin will determine the Bnd project folders in the Bnd Workspace, include them in the Gradle build, and apply itself to the root project.
This will result in the `biz.aQute.bnd` Gradle plugin being applied to each project which is a Bnd project.
With this approach, you don't even need a `build.gradle` file for the root project.
But you can use a `build.gradle` file in the root project to apply common configuration across all your Bnd projects:

```groovy
subprojects {
  if (plugins.hasPlugin("biz.aQute.bnd")) {
    // additional configuration for Bnd projects
  }
}
```

The second approach, for when you already have a `settings.gradle` file which includes the desired projects and you don't want the set of projects to include to be computed, is to put the `plugins` block in the root project's `build.gradle` file:

```groovy
plugins {
  id "biz.aQute.bnd.workspace" version "7.0.0"
}
```

While this is the same as the previous `settings.gradle` example, since it is the root project's `build.gradle` file, it requires that your `settings.gradle` file has already included the necessary projects in the Gradle build.
The plugin will apply the `biz.aQute.bnd` Gradle plugin to each Gradle project which is a Bnd project.

In general, your Gradle scripts will not apply the `biz.aQute.bnd` Gradle plugin directly to a project since this is handled by using the `biz.aQute.bnd.workspace` Gradle plugin in the `settings.gradle` file or the `build.gradle` file in the root project.

## Gradle Configuration Cache Not Supported

The tasks of the Gradle Plugin for Bnd Workspace Builds use the Bnd Workspace model objects such as [Workspace][8] and [Project][9] at task execution time to perform Bnd operations.
However, Gradle's [Configuration Cache][23] support requires that all objects used at task execution time must be serializable and the Bnd Workspace model objects are not serializable.
So the Gradle Plugin for Bnd Workspace Builds cannot be used with Gradle's Configuration Cache.

## Gradle Tasks

The `biz.aQute.bnd` Gradle Plugin extends the standard [Gradle Java plugin][3].
It modifies some of the standard Java plugin tasks as necessary and also adds some additional tasks.
Running `gradle tasks --all` in a project will provide a complete list of the tasks available within the project.

The dependencies for the project are configured from the path information specified in the `bnd.bnd` file such as [`-buildpath`][4] and [`-testpath`][5].
These paths are then used by various tasks such as `compileJava` and `compileTestJava`.

The `jar` task uses Bnd to build the project's bundles.

The `test` task runs any plain JUnit tests in the project.

The `check` task runs all verification tasks in the project, including `test` and `testOSGi`.

### Additional Tasks

The `jarDependencies` task jars all projects the project depends on.

The `buildDependencies` task assembles and tests all projects the project depends on.

The `release` task releases the project's bundles to the [`-releaserepo`][6], if one is configured for the project.

The `releaseDependencies` task releases all projects the project depends on.

The `releaseNeeded` task releases the project and all projects it depends on.

The `testOSGi` task runs any OSGi JUnit tests in the project's `bnd.bnd` file by launching a framework and running the tests in the launched framework.
This means the `bnd.bnd` file must have the necessary `-runfw` and `-runbundles` to support the test bundles built by the project.
The `check` task depends on the `testOSGi` task.

The `checkDependencies` task runs the `check` task on all projects the project depends on.

The `checkNeeded` task runs the `check` task on the project and all projects it depends on.

The `cleanDependencies` task cleans all projects the project depends on.

The `cleanNeeded` task cleans the project and all projects it depends on.

The `export.`_name_ tasks, one per bndrun file in the project, exports the _name_`.bndrun` file to an executable jar.

The `export` task will export all the bndrun files to executable jars.

The `runbundles.`_name_ tasks, one per bndrun file in the project, creates a distribution of the [-runbundles][7] of the _name_`.bndrun` file.

The `runbundles` task will create distributions of the runbundles for all the bndrun files.

The `resolve.`_name_ tasks, one per bndrun file in the project, resolves the _name_`.bndrun` file and updates the `-runbundles` instruction in the file.

The `resolve` task resolves all the bndrun files and updates the `-runbundles` instruction in each bndrun file.

The `run.`_name_ tasks, one per bndrun file in the project, runs the _name_`.bndrun` file.

The `testrun.`_name_ tasks, one per bndrun file in the project, runs the OSGi JUnit tests in the _name_`.bndrun` file.

The `echo` task will display some help information on the dependencies, paths and configuration of the project.

The `bndproperties` task will display the Bnd properties of the project.

## Customizing a project's Gradle build

If you do need to write a `build.gradle` file for a Bnd project, there are some properties of the Bnd Gradle Plugins you will find useful.

* The `bndWorkspace` property of the project for the Bnd Workspace contains the [Workspace][8] object.
* The `bnd.project` property of the project contains the [Project][9] object.

Bnd properties for a project can be accessed in several ways.
Given the example Bnd property name `foo`, you can use the [`bnd` extension][16], `bnd.get("foo", "defaultValue")`, or directly `bnd.foo`.
To access Bnd properties without any macro processing you can use the [`unprocessed` function][16], `bnd.unprocessed("foo", "defaultValue")`.

## Using other JVM languages with the Bnd Gradle Plugins for Bnd Workspace builds

When you use the Gradle plugin for another JVM language like Groovy, Scala, or Kotlin with your Bnd Workspace build, the Bnd Gradle Plugin will configure the language's `srcDirs` for the `main` and `test` source sets to use the Bnd source and test source folders.

---

# Using the latest development SNAPSHOT build of the Bnd Gradle Plugins

If you want to try the latest development SNAPSHOT build of the  Bnd Gradle Plugins, you will need to refer to the snapshot repository and select the latest version (`+`) of the plugin.
For example, replace the `pluginManagement` block (in `settings.gradle`) with a `buildscript` script block, to configure the repository and version of the plugin jar:

```groovy
buildscript {
  repositories {
    maven {
      url = uri("https://bndtools.jfrog.io/bndtools/libs-snapshot")
    }
  }
  dependencies {
    classpath "biz.aQute.bnd:biz.aQute.bnd.gradle:+"
  }
}
```

Then replace the `plugins` block to use the `apply plugin:` syntax to apply the plugin.
For example:

```groovy
apply plugin: "biz.aQute.bnd.workspace"
```

If you want to use the latest development SNAPSHOT version on a regular basis, you will need to also need to add the following to the `buildscript` block to ensure Gradle checks more frequently for updates:


```groovy
buildscript {
  ...
  /* Since the files in the repository change with each build, we need to recheck for changes */
  configurations.classpath {
    resolutionStrategy {
      cacheChangingModulesFor 30, "minutes"
      cacheDynamicVersionsFor 30, "minutes"
    }
  }
  dependencies {
    components {
      all { ComponentMetadataDetails details ->
        details.changing = true
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Remember, if you are using the Gradle daemon, you will need to stop it after making the change to use the development SNAPSHOT versions to ensure Gradle stops using the prior version of the plugin.

# Using the latest Milestone/Release Candidate build of the Bnd Gradle Plugins

If you want to try the latest milestone or release candidate build of the  Bnd Gradle Plugins, you will need to refer to the release repository, `https://bndtools.jfrog.io/bndtools/libs-release`, and select the desired version of the plugin. This can be done as above for the SNAPSHOT builds or via the `pluginManagement` section (in `settings.gradle`). For example:

```groovy
pluginManagement {
  plugins {
    id "biz.aQute.bnd.builder" version "6.0.0-M1"
  }
  repositories {
    maven {
      url = uri("https://bndtools.jfrog.io/bndtools/libs-release")
    }
  }
}
```
