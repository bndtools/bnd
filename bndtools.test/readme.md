# TEST WORKSPACE

This workspace is a test workspace. If you run bndtools in debug then you can select this workspace (just change 'core' in the pre filled in workspace name to 'test').

The purpose of this workspace is to have no warnings and no errors when opened up. To accept bndtools, it should be possible to add, remove, and clean all projects without creating warnings/errors.
