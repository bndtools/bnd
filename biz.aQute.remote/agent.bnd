#
# REMOTE AGENT
#

Bundle-Description: \
	This bundle acts as an agent for the remote launching architecture. When started, it \
	will bind to port ${aQute.agent.server.port} and listens for incoming requests. When \
	this port is accessed, it will open a link that allows it to act as an OSGi management \
	agent that is remotely controlled. When this connection is closed, it will remove \
	all bundles that were installed through this connection. The protocol is highly optimized \
	to make this also work for small devices and slow connections.

#
# The agent can run as a real bundle or
# as an embedded bundle on the -runpath
#
